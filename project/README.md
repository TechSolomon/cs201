# Project Roadmap

## Word Count
Write a program to read a text file and output a list of all the words the appear in the file, along with how many times each appears. Note that “Dog”, “dog”, and “dog!” contain the same word.  Suggestion: Use *std::map*. The key are words. The associated value tells how many times the word has been used.

## Text Readability 
Write a program to read a text file and compute the two Flesch-Kincaid readability scores for the text: *reading ease* and *grade level*.  Note: Both of these readability scores require finding the number of syllables in each word. This is difficult to do well in a short program. Code that makes a decent guess will be okay, for this project.
